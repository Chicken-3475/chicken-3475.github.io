# HTML-Project
These HTML pages have information taken from various sources, cited below.
The Page for VH-XZB has experimental symbols added to increase user-friendliness, and to make it look tidy.
Please open index.html in the root folder, and all other html pages are accessible from there.

Currently, the databases for both Virgin Australia and Jetstar have not been added, so it is not an error when these do not redirect you to a different page of the site.

The table used as an overview of aircraft stats is searchable and sortable by tail number. The sorting system works as follows:
1 click: A-Z
2 clicks: Z-A

Some aircraft tail numbers (VH-XZA, XZB, XZP, EBA, EBP, ZNA) are linked to another page listing their production timeline, showing aircraft photos and additional statistics about the aircraft, including a live tracker map of its current location (provided by Flightradar24).

Please feel free to look around at the code for the site (compiled in Notepad++)
